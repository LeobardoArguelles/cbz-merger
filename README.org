* CBZ Merger

** What is it?
A cli-tool to merge several CBZ (zip) files into one main archive, or several archives divided by volume.

** Why use it?
Works great if you download full comics/mangas, which come in come organized in CBZ files (one CBZ per chapter, each one containing
one image per page).
That's a lot of images!

And if you would rather organize them in a single main file, or a file per volume, this tool will do the work for you.

This is also great if you read them on some kind of e-reader, like Kobo, since you will have less files to manage.

** Export modes
You can merge all your files into one of the two following options:
+ One main file containing all the pages of your comic/manga.
+ One file per volume, each one containing only the pages of its chapters.

*Each of these can be exported into either PDF, or CBZ.*

** Pre-requisites
You'll only need Python3 and pip.

I'm using Python 3.9.5, so if you got any problems, try to use at least
this version.

*** APT package manager (Debian / Ubuntu / Linux Mint)
#+begin_src sh
# First update your local system's repository list
sudo apt-get update
# Install python3
sudo apt-get install python
# Install pip for python3
sudo apt install python3-pip
#+end_src

*** Arch Linux
#+begin_src sh
# Install python3
sudo pacman -S python
# Install pip
sudo pacman -S python-pip
#+end_src

*** DNF package manager (Fedora)
#+begin_src sh
# This installs both python and pip, in a nice little bundle. How convenient!
sudo dnf install python3
#+end_src

*** Yum package manager (Redhat / RHEL / CentOS)
#+begin_src sh
# Install python3
sudo yum install python
# pip is not available on core repositories, so you'll need this
sudo yum install epel-release
# Now you can actually install pip
sudo yum install python-pip
#+end_src

** Installation
You'll need to:

1. Clone the repository
2. Move inside the repo's directory
3. [Optional] Create a virtual environment
   This might not be obligatory, but is highly recommendable to have a virtual environment for each project, to avoid conflicts between libraries and
   versions.
4. Install the requirements (remember that you need Python for this)

#+begin_src sh
# Get the repo
git clone https://github.com/LeobardoArguelles/cbz-merger.git
cd cbz-merger

# Create a virtual environment
pip install virtualenv
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
#+end_src

Then go into [[*Usage][Usage]].

** Usage
Inside the repository:

*** Basic usage
#+begin_src sh

#+end_src

** Closing thoughts
This is the first tool that I actually release for public usage.

I made it for myself, but I tried to generalize its usage so that it can be used by other persons.
I hope that you find it useful.

If you have any problem feel free to open an issue, and if you've got suggestions or ideas to expand this tool,
I would love for you to get in touch.

** TODO
- [ ] Finish usage section from README.org
